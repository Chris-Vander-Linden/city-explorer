    Name of feature: Map: As a user, I want to see a map of the city so that I can see the layout of the area I want to explore.

    Notes: I had the original static map done in about an hour but wanted to add an interactive map because I know this will set me up better for other features.  I also learned more about the React lifecycle methods since I had to wait for components to mount to the DOM before attaching the map.



    Name of feature: Errors: As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.

    Start time: 1/26/23 1:00 PM

    Finish time: 1/27/23

    Actual time needed to complete: 2 hours.
